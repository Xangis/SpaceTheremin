Changes from Version 1.01 to 1.10:

- Changed sound generation from OpenAL to PortAudio.
- Changed modulation sizer to resize with window so it gets bigger if window is enlarged.
- Changed default settings to be 55 to 880 Hz, or 4 octaves of A

Problems:

- Waveforms are not correct. There seems to be some odd oscillator synchronization problem.
